# Changelog

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added
- **Multi-provider support**: Gemini CLI and Codex CLI alongside Claude Code
- **YAML frontmatter**: Metadata in markdown files (date, provider, project, session, cwd)
- **Session-based files**: Each session gets its own file with session ID in filename
- **Menu bar provider toggles**: Enable/disable each provider without opening Settings
- **Smart sync optimization**:
  - Cold start: fetches all of today's conversations
  - Warm sync: uses cutoff date for efficiency
  - Leaf folder optimization for deep directory structures (Codex)

### Changed
- Filename format now includes session ID: `YYYY-MM-DD-provider-project-sessionid.md`
- Settings: Provider toggles moved to menu bar, Paths section shows only path configuration
- Folder scanning skips unchanged folders based on modification date

### Fixed
- Codex system messages (permissions, AGENTS.md, environment) now filtered out
- Gemini new session format (`chats/*.json`) now supported
- Parent folder modification date issue for nested structures (Codex YYYY/MM/DD)
